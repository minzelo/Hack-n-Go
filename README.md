Hack’n Go is a beginner-friendly web application designed to gamify cybersecurity education through interactive quizzes and bite-sized learning modules. Inspired by Duolingo, the app empowers users to learn crucial cybersecurity concepts while earning points, tracking progress, and competing with others on the leaderboard.

This project was developed as part of a university Software Engineering course by a team of cybersecurity students, aiming to create an accessible platform for raising cybersecurity awareness across different skill levels.

## 🔥 Why Hack’n Go?

In a digital age where cyber threats are evolving rapidly, many users remain unaware of basic security practices. Hack’n Go was built to bridge this knowledge gap by offering a simple, fun, and accessible way to learn cybersecurity fundamentals. The app focuses on technical topics such as OWASP Top 10 and ISO 27001, repackaged into modules and quizzes designed for hands-on microlearning.

Unlike traditional learning platforms, Hack’n Go uses gamification elements such as daily challenges, levels, and leaderboards to keep users motivated. This approach encourages consistent learning and helps foster healthy cybersecurity habits for individuals, students, and professionals alike.
